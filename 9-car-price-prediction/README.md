Overview
We are about to build an Artificial Neural Network which can predict the price of a given vehicle by the information related to it (the model, engine capacity, etc…).
First of all, the dataset we have, has to be cleansed (removing unrelated information or NaN values or filling the NaN values, etc...) and needs some data preprocessing.
 After that, we need to build a model (ANN) and feed a fraction of the dataset, and then we test it with the other fraction to see whether the model can predict the prices with a good precision or not.
