## Library:
- numpy
- pandas
- keras
- tensorflow
## Descreption:
The purpose of this project is to predict housing prices using a dataset of house specifications.
### - Dataset
The database in this project was randomly created by the `Make Random House.cpp` file.
You can use this file to create new datasets for yourself or use the `house-3.csv` datasets.
In the `Make Random House.cpp` file, neighborhoods a have a higher priority than neighborhoods b and neighborhoods b have a higher priority than neighborhoods c.
These neighborhoods are stored in arrays a, b, c.

You can also use real datasets. Real datasets need to be checked, Because similar houses may have a big price difference, And this may lead to incorrect network learning.
